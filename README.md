# 📚 Library Management System – SQL Project

This project is part of my internship at Elevate Labs. It demonstrates the design and development of a normalized relational database using MySQL for managing a library system. The project covers everything from schema creation to advanced SQL queries, including JOINs, constraints, views, triggers, and functions.

---

## 🚀 Project Goals

- 📌 Apply SQL fundamentals in a real-world scenario
- 🧠 Practice advanced query logic using multiple JOIN types
- 🔐 Implement data integrity with constraints and foreign keys
- 🔄 Understand relationships between entities like Members, Books, Loans, Staff, etc.

---

## 🧩 Database Features

- 🔷 Normalized schema with 7+ interrelated tables
- 🔑 Primary and foreign keys with proper constraints
- 🔁 Advanced SQL queries including `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `UNION`, and `SELF JOIN`
- 🔧 Views, triggers, user-defined functions for real-time operations
- 📊 Scalable structure suitable for analytics or dashboard integration

## ✅ Highlight: Task 5 – SQL JOIN Operations

A complete set of SQL JOIN queries demonstrating:

- 🔹 `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, `FULL OUTER JOIN (UNION)`
- 🔹 `WHERE` filters with joins
- 🔹 Multi-table joins (Members + Books + Categories)
- 🔹 Aggregation with `GROUP BY`
- 🔹 `CROSS JOIN` for cartesian products
- 🔹 `SELF JOIN` for staff-manager relationships

➡️ See: [`task_5_README.md`](./task_5_README.md) for all 10 queries and use cases.

## 🎯 Outcome

> Successfully built a scalable and relational database with real-time scenarios, practiced all major SQL operations, and prepared the groundwork for integrating with Power BI or web-based dashboards.

## 📌 Note

This repository is educational and internship-focused. All queries were tested in MySQL (InnoDB engine). Sample data was created to simulate real-world operations.
